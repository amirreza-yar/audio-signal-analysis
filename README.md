# Audio Signal Processing and Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of tools and scripts for processing and analyzing audio signals. It includes functionalities for reading, filtering, manipulating, and visualizing audio data. The project utilizes Python libraries such as `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` to perform tasks like noise reduction, speed alteration, frequency domain filtering, audio reversal, and sound mixing. The repository also features functions to generate and display spectrograms, providing a visual representation of the audio signals over time.

## Key Features

- **Read and Write WAV Files**: Efficiently read and write WAV audio files using `scipy.io.wavfile`.
- **Noise Reduction**: Apply low-pass filters to remove noise from audio signals.
- **Speed Alteration**: Change the playback speed of audio files.
- **Audio Reversal**: Reverse audio signals.
- **Sound Mixing**: Combine multiple audio files in the frequency domain.
- **Visualization**: Generate and visualize amplitude-frequency plots and spectrograms.
